# Face Detection Vs Face Recognition
Face detection and Face recognition are sometimes confused with each other

### Face detection
It is the algorithm for detecting whether or not a face is present in an image. 

### Face Recognition
Face Recognition algorithm recognises/identifies whose face it's being detected.

### How TOs

* **Haarcascade** is an OpenCV built-in algorithm (*Classifiers*) use for face detection/recognition.

* **Deep Learning model** can as well be built for face recognition
